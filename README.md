Nice Toast is a stunning and highly customizable toast library for Android written in Kotlin. Elevate your app's user experience by replacing standard toasts with eye-catching, animated, and informative notifications that look great in both light and dark themes.

Whether you need to show a success message, an error, a warning, or just some info, NiceToast provides a variety of styles to fit your app's design language.

## âœ¨ Preview

(Here you would insert screenshots or GIFs of your library in action. For example: a GIF showing the different toast types in both light and dark mode.)

## ðŸš€ Installation

Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` file:

### Kotlin (`build.gradle.kts`)

```kotlin
// In build.gradle.kts
implementation("com.github.yourusername:nicetoast:1.0.0")
```

### Groovy (`build.gradle`)

```groovy
// In build.gradle
implementation 'com.github.yourusername:nicetoast:1.0.0'
```

## ðŸ“– How to Use

### Basic Toasts

Displaying a toast is as simple as calling one of the built-in methods from your Activity.

```kotlin
// Success Toast (Side-bar style)
NiceToast().createNiceToast(
    activity = this,
    message = "Your profile was updated successfully!",
    toastType = NiceToastType.SUCCESS,
    position = Gravity.TOP,
    duration = 3000L,
    font = null // Optional: pass a Typeface object
)

// Error Toast (Solid background style)
NiceToast().createNiceToastWithBackground(
    activity = this,
    title = "Oh No!",
    message = "Failed to upload the file.",
    toastType = NiceToastType.ERROR,
    position = Gravity.BOTTOM,
    duration = 4000L,
    font = null
)

// Dark Mode Warning Toast
NiceToast().createDarkNiceToast(
    activity = this,
    message = "Please check your network connection.",
    toastType = NiceToastType.WARNING,
    position = Gravity.CENTER,
    duration = 3000L,
    font = null
)
```

### All-in-One Function

For more advanced control, you can use the `magicCreate` function, which allows you to configure every aspect of the toast in a single call. This is useful when you need to dynamically set properties like dark mode or the background style.

```kotlin
niceToast.magicCreate(
    activity = this,
    title = "Low Battery",
    message = "Your battery is running low. Please connect to a charger.",
    toastType = NiceToastType.WARNING,
    position = TOAST_GRAVITY_BOTTOM,
    duration = LONG_DURATION,
    font = ResourcesCompat.getFont(this, R.font.poppins_bold),
    isDarkMode = isDarkMode,
    isFullBackground = fullBackground
)
```

### Toast Types

The library includes several predefined types:

*   `NiceToastType.SUCCESS`
*   `NiceToastType.ERROR`
*   `NiceToastType.WARNING`
*   `NiceToastType.INFO`
*   `NiceToastType.DELETE`
*   `NiceToastType.NO_INTERNET`

### Global Configuration

You can customize the look and feel of all toasts globally. This is perfect for matching the library to your app's brand colors. It's recommended to do this once in your `Application` class.

```kotlin
// In your Application class's onCreate() method
NiceToast().configure {
    // Set custom colors (using @ColorRes)
    successToastColor = R.color.my_app_success_color
    errorToastColor = R.color.my_app_error_color
    
    // Set a custom background color for the side-bar style
    infoBackgroundToastColor = R.color.my_app_info_background

    // Set a custom animation for the icon (using @AnimRes)
    customAnimRes = R.anim.my_custom_fade_in
}

// To reset all configurations to their default values
NiceToast().resetAll()
```
